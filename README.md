## Olympic Medals Web App

This repository was built as an example of how I build software.

It is a Python/Django and TypeScript/React stack. Individual Readmes can be found in the relevant directories.

The goal was to build an app that:

- Loaded the raw data
- Served a medal tables API endpoint
- Presented a medal table front end with sortable columns.

### Data Credits

The raw data in this task has been adapted and modified from an original set made available by The Guardian available on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games.
